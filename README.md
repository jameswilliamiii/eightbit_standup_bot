# Eight Bit Stand-up Bot
Wouldn't it be cool if we could skip some meetings and just have our stand-up via chat? Well now we can!

### Bot Setup
You will need to create a file `./.env` to setup your environment variables.  The current environment variables required in this file are:

* `ENV['HIPCHAT_JID']`
* `ENV['HIPCHAT_PASSWORD']`
